# FriendLocator


FriendLocator is the Android and iOS app here to help you find and meet up with your friends!

Users can create user profiles and add each other as friends. Once you're friends with another user, 
you can share your location and get access to their location both of which appear on an easy to use
map interface.

What's that? You don't want Wierd Carl to know you're downtown when you said you weren't? Have no fears!
FriendLocator requires users to grant others permission to see their location, and any location sharing
session can be stopped at any time! If that's not enough, you can delete friends any time too!

Friend locator was written by Luke Shepherd, Kyle Danna, Alice Yu, Sean Elliott and Brian Tang. 

Source files for the front end can be found in the client-src directory, while source files for the back end
can be found in the server-files directory. 

Original frontend source code files are located in client-src/components/ as well as
changes made to client-src/index.android.js, client-src/android/app/build.gradle, and client-src/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Specifications for the server API can be found in the file Packet_Header_Notes.txt
Notes on how to run the project can be found in the file testing_react.txt

Testing was done on a Google Nexus 5 emulator running Android 6.0 (API 23) and an HTC One handset running Android 5.1 (API 22)
